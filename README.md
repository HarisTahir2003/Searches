# Searches Assignment (Artificial Intelligence)

This Jupyter Notebook explores the concepts of Searches in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on three search algorithms (and slight variations of each):
<ol>
<li> A* </li>
<li> Best-first search </li>
<li> Breadth-first search </li>
</ol> <br>

The notebook is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of these search algorithms, and includes practical implementations, visualizations, and evaluations of the algorithms. <br> 

The Searches folder contains the following files:
- A .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) that contains all the code regarding the assignment including text blocks explaining portions of the code
- A corresponding .py file
- a png file of a screenshot of how visualizations are used in the Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

Logistic regression is a Machine Learning technique used for binary or multi-class classification that models the relationship between a dependent binary/multi-class variable and one or more independent variables. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous outcomes, logistic regression predicts the probability of an outcome.

 This assignment provides a clear and concise example of how to implement multi-class logistic regression from scratch using Python.

## Training and Visualization

The entire training process alongside the maths involved is explained in detail in the jupyter notebook. 
- Note: You need to be proficient in Python Programming to fully implement the complex algorithms shown in this assignment.

## Lessons

A logistic regression project can teach a variety of valuable skills and concepts, including:

- Data Preprocessing: How to clean and prepare data for analysis, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

- Feature Selection: Identifying which features (variables) are most important for making predictions and how to choose them effectively.

- Model Building: Understanding how to build a logistic regression model, including splitting data into training and testing sets, fitting the model, and predicting outcomes.

- Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of your model and understand its accuracy.

- Interpreting Results: Understanding the results of the logistic regression model and what they signify.

- Algorithm Implementation: Learning about the underlying algorithm used in linear regression and how it optimizes the line of best fit.

<h4> 1. This image shows how the value of the Root-Mean-Square-Error changes for various training and testing datasets as the value of the regularization parameter (lambda) is gradually increased from 0 to 10. The four datasets include the training and testing datasets of each of the analytical and gradient-descent solutions. </h4>
