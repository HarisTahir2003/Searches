# Searches Assignment (Artificial Intelligence)

This Jupyter Notebook explores the concepts of Searches in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on three search algorithms (and slight variations of each):
<ol>
<li> A* </li>
<li> Best-first search </li>
<li> Breadth-first search </li>
</ol> <br>

The notebook is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of these search algorithms, and includes practical implementations, visualizations, and evaluations of the algorithms. <br> 

The Searches folder contains the following files:
- A .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) that contains all the code regarding the assignment including text blocks explaining portions of the code
- A corresponding .py file
- a png file of a screenshot of how visualizations are used in the Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

Search algorithms are fundamental techniques in AI for navigating and finding solutions in large problem spaces. They systematically explore paths or possibilities to identify optimal solutions, such as the shortest route or best outcome. These algorithms, including A*, Best-first search, and Breadth-first search, play a crucial role in applications ranging from route planning to decision-making systems.

 This assignment provides a clear and concise example of how to implement these search algorithms from scratch using Python.

## Training and Visualization

The entire training process alongside the maths involved is explained in detail in the jupyter notebook. 
- Note: You need to be proficient in Python Programming to fully implement the complex algorithms shown in this assignment.

## Challenges

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implementing search algorithms can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or complex graphs. To address this, optimizing the algorithms for efficiency, using heuristics to prune the search space, and leveraging data structures like priority queues can significantly improve performance.

2. **Memory Usage**: Search algorithms often require substantial memory to store nodes and paths, which can be challenging for large-scale problems.

3. **Heuristic Design**: For algorithms like A* and Best-first search, designing effective heuristics is critical for performance. Testing various heuristics and using domain-specific knowledge to refine them can enhance the algorithmâ€™s accuracy and efficiency.

5. **Complexity of Implementation**: Implementing and integrating search algorithms can be complex, especially when dealing with variations or combining multiple algorithms. Careful planning, modular design, and thorough testing can help manage this complexity and ensure robust functionality.

## Screenshots
<h4> This image is an example of several used in this assignment. This one in specific shows a map representation of the modified A* algorithm used to go to multiple destinations in the most optimal way. <br> 
The diagram shows a map of the Lahore University of Management Sciences. The light blue lines show all the possible ways to walk around LUMS whereas the dark blue lines show the result of the modified A* algorithm from the source (shown in green) to three different destinations (shown in red). <br>
You can change the last code block to change the source or destinations. You can find the node values of the different buildings in LUMS by inspecting the first map in the assignment under the heading <strong>Road Network</strong>.</h4>
